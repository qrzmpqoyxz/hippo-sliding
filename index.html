  <h2>A hippo slide is when hippos go to the top of a mountain with bathtubs and slide down the mountain in them. Sometimes they go so fast they keep going for a long time. Hippo slides are aften airborne. if a hippo slide gets to a town they have such force they can go straight through multiple houses before slowing down. The world record is one hippo going straight through 22 houses. Usually a hippo slide has multiple hippos going after another so if your house is hit by s hippo more will probably come.</h2>

  <h2>Just imagine a hippo in a bathtub suddenly crashing through a second story window at extreme speed then proceeding to go through every wall until there is a big hole in your house.
